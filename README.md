# Titanic Survival Analysis 

This project dives into the analysis of the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in passenger survival. Using a combination of data analysis, visualization, and statistical techniques, the project reveals insights into factors affecting survival, such as age, class, and family size.

## Project Overview
The Titanic tragedy remains one of the most studied disasters in history. This project analyzes passenger demographics and survival rates to answer critical questions:
* What factors contributed to higher survival rates?
* How did variables like age, gender, class, and family size impact survival?
* Can the data reveal trends and actionable insights?

** This analysis is presented through an interactive Power BI dashboard, supported by Python-based preprocessing and exploration.
**

##  Project Target
1. **Analyze survival patterns** across key demographics.
2. **Understand the impact of passenger characteristics** such as class, family size, and gender.
3. **Visualize survival trends** in a clear and interactive format for stakeholders.
4. Build a foundation for predictive modeling to estimate survival chances.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**:
  - **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploration.
- **Power BI**:
  - Interactive dashboards for advanced visualizations.
  - DAX measures and calculated columns for additional insights.

## Key Insights
- **Gender**: Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
- **Class (Pclass)**: First-class passengers had better survival odds.
- **Family Size**:
  * Small family groups had the highest survival rates.
  * Solo travelers and large families were more at risk.
  **Embarkation Point**: Passengers embarking from Cherbourg (C) had higher survival rates.
