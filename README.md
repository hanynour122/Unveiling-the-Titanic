The goal of the project is to uncover key insights about the passengers and their survival rates.

We used SQL to clean the data and handle missing values for age, cabin, and embarked locations. We calculated median values and filled in the missing entries, and categorized passengers into age groups such as Baby, Children, Adolescence, MidLife, Adult, and Oldest.

We created a variety of charts and tables in Power BI to illustrate passenger demographics and survival rates

We utilized SQL queries to clean and analyze the data, and used DAX in Power BI to create calculated columns and measures. We leveraged various Power BI visual types to convey data effectively and highlighted kpi such as the total number of passengers and the sum of passengers who traveled alone.
